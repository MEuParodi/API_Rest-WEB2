## PARAMS

# Default params
In the event that some query parameters are omitted, GET requests will return the established default values.
They are page 1, limit 30, sorted by exp_id in ascending order. 

# Pagination
You will be able to paginate the results by adding the limit and page query params to the GET requests:
The following example, it returns page 1 with 10 experiences:

Page 1 - limit 10
/experiencies?page=1&limit=10

# Order
The results can be sorted by adding the orderBy (column to sort by) and order (asc or desc) params to the GET requests:
Examples: 

Order by price desc 
/experiencies?orderBy=price&orderBy=desc
 
Order by days asc
/experiencies?orderBy=days&orderBy=asc

# Filter by condition
Results can be returned filtered by column by adding filtercolumn (field to filter) and filtervalue (column value) query parameters to the GET request.
Examples: 

Filter by column "days" = 16
/experiencies?columnBy=days&filtervalue=16
